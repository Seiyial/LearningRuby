## The List of Study Places

Welcome to the first chapter. We'll be doing __data types__. Examples of data types are `strings`, `integers`, `floats`, `arrays` and `hashes` (data types will vary by language, these are for Ruby).



#### Strings

Strings are denoted by `''` or `""`.

```ruby
'example string'

"abcdefGHIJKL012_345!@$@$%&*$#"
```



#### Integers

Integers are digit-only values.

```ruby
0

34

13269
```



#### Floats

Floats are digit-only values with decimal places.

```ruby
1.0

0.887

98734.34563
```



#### Arrays

Arrays are lists that can contain sub-items.

```ruby
['Dog', 'Cat', 'Horse']

['One', 2, 'Thr33']
```



#### Hashes

Hashes are lists of **key-value pairs**.

```ruby
{name: 'Sayhao', religion: 'Humanism', imaginary_power: 'Aurora Bending'}

# This is a hash containing information about 'Sayhao'.
# The keys are name, religion and imaginary_power;
# The values are 'Sayhao', 'Humanism' and 'Aurora Bending'.
```



### Something to make

Create an array of hashes that lists at least 5 **study places**.

Each **study place** record should include *information* (organised in key-value pairs) about its:

- name,
- rough location,
- average level of crowdedness ("low", "medium" or "high"),
- price level ("expensive", "intermediate" or "affordable"),
- How much you usually spend at the place.

And... try to keep the keys concise yet descriptive.
