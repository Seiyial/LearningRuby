## The List of Study Places II

### Revisiones

Make a cheatsheet of the things you've been taught, so you can refer to them later. You'll be learning a lot of new things from now on, so make sure you have the notes when you need them!

Some things you might want to write down on the cheatsheet:

#### Ruby

- String syntax (`''` or `""`)
- Integer syntax (`1234`)
- Array syntax (['a', 'b', 'c'])
- Hash syntax ({ a: 'b', c: 'd' })
- Symbol syntax (`:the_symbol`)

- Accessing values in array ( array[index] )
- Accessing values in hash ( hash[key] )
- Nested access ( array_of_hashes[index][key] )

- `print` and `puts`
- `array.each do |x| ... end`

#### Bash (shell script)

- `cd` change directory
- How to `cd` into a child directory
- How to `cd` into a parent directory
- What does `ls` do

#### Git

- how to commit and push:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "MESSAGE HERE"
$ git push origin master
```

### Practices

- Look in the file `practice1.rb`. There is an array of `1000` numbers, each of a random value between 0 and 1000 e.g. 244. Edit the file so that it will `puts` the **sum** of the 1000 numbers.

- Look in the file `practice2.rb`. It contains the array of hashes from last lesson with two new additions. Configure the code so that for each study place, it will `puts` the **name**, then the **spending** of that place, then a blank line. E.g:
Yoshinoya
6 to 10 dollars

Coffeebean
5 to 8 dollars
